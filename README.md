[Optimizing: Urho3D::Image::Clear](optimizing_Urho3D_Image_Clear.md): Kinda similar to the pixel copying.  
[Optimizing: Compile Time](optimizing_compile_time.md): General tips and an experiment.  
[Better Typed C++](better_typed_c++.md): Issues with C++ types and conversions and fixing them with current C++.  
[Converter Classes](converter_classes.md): Using classes to pass different wrapped arguments.

## About

I had the idea to publish articles about various topics for quite some time but don't really have a good place to publish them.  
Then I had the idea to use GitHub until I find something better, please contact me if you have suggestions. I would like a revision system (like GitHub has), some user interactions like watches and stars (like GitHub has) and user comments (GitHub doesn't have that). Also it should be possible for others to contribute (that GitHub can do via access or push requests). Some wiki- or HTML-style markup possibilities should be there as well (like text styles, links, embedding images, videos, code blocks with syntax highlighting. GitHub partly has this.).

Some people use blogs for such things but I tend to edit stuff written in the past and something wiki-like is more suited. Also some things don't really age as in getting outdated, which a blog with big dates always feels like.
